		-When removing teams from league:
			Consider all games which this team is playing in - all games need to be deleted
			Consider division/conference balance - any teams need to be moved?
		-When adding teams to the league:
			Consider game structure - new team must play games under the same structure as all initial teams
			Consider division/conference balance - any teams need to be moved?
		-When removing players from the league:
			Should be able to delete player from db, and that's it - determine if this is 100% sufficient
		-When adding players to the league:
			Should player be added to free agency, or directly to a team?
				- if added directly to a team, is the player count limit enforced?
